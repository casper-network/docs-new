class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="what-is-casper">What is Casper?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-casper" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Casper is a new <a href="/glossary/T/#turing-complete-blockchain">Turing-complete</a> smart-contracting platform, backed by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and WebAssembly (Wasm). The network is a <a href="/glossary/P/#permissionless">permissionless</a>, decentralized, public blockchain.</p><p>The network&#x27;s consensus protocol is called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02159.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highway</a>, and it has several benefits over classic Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols. First, Highway allows networks to reach higher thresholds of <em>finality</em>, meaning that more blocks are finalized, and validators agree to add them to the blockchain. Second, the protocol achieves flexibility by expressing block finality in ways not possible in BFT models. This protocol is built on the <a href="https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">correct-by-construction (CBC) Casper</a> research.</p><p>Additionally, the Casper Network is optimized for enterprise and developer adoption. While leveraging blockchain technology, the network seeks to accelerate business operations via unique features like predictable network fees, upgradeable contracts, on-chain governance, privacy flexibility, and developer-friendly languages. Casper&#x27;s <a href="/dapp-dev-guide/build-on-casper/introduction/">core features and strengths</a> enable developers and enterprises to reap the benefits of blockchain technology.</p><p>Casper also solves the scalability trilemma. Notably, the network is optimized for security, decentralization, and high throughput. All this is achieved while evolving to provide leading solutions for open-source projects and enterprises.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="how-does-casper-work">How does Casper work?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-does-casper-work" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Casper relies on a group of validators to verify transactions and uphold the network. Unlike Proof-of-Work networks, which need to centralize validators for economies of scale, Casper allows for the geographical decentralization of validators. Casper validators verify transactions based on staked tokens and receive CSPR rewards for participating in the PoS consensus mechanism. CSPR is the native token on the Casper Network.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="where-can-i-learn-more">Where can I learn more?<a class="hash-link" href="#where-can-i-learn-more" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Follow the links below to learn more about the Casper Network.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="/workflow/">How To&#x27;s</a></td><td>Guides for interacting with the Casper Network</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/dapp-dev-guide/">Developers</a></td><td>Get started with smart contract development on the Casper blockchain in Rust</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/operators/">Node Operators</a></td><td>Run node infrastructure on the Casper Network</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/design/">Design</a></td><td>Understand the architecture of the Casper Network, including network communication, execution semantics, account management, block structure, global state, serialization, unforgeable references, and tokens</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/economics/">Economics</a></td><td>Conceptualize Casper&#x27;s economic activity by understanding consensus, runtime, ecosystem, and the macroeconomy</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/staking/">Staking Guide</a></td><td>Participate in the protocol by staking CSPR tokens with a validator in the Casper Network</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/glossary/">Glossary</a></td><td>Explore key definitions in the context of the Casper Network</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/faq/">FAQ</a></td><td>Find answers regarding the Casper Network, CasperLabs, and the CSPR token sale Changelog Review past technical releases and changelogs for the Casper Network</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="disclaimer">Disclaimer<a class="hash-link" href="#disclaimer" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>By accepting this CasperLabs Tech Spec (this “Whitepaper”), each recipient hereof acknowledges and agrees that is not authorised to, and may not, forward or deliver this Whitepaper, electronically or otherwise, to any other person or reproduce this Whitepaper in any manner whatsoever.

Inability of such companies to manage their affairs, including any failure to attract and retain appropriate personnel, could affect the completion and functionality of the Casper blockchain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with CSPR relative value</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that a purchaser of CSPR may experience financial losses relative to other assets, including fiat currency and/or any other cryptocurrency (including any cryptocurrency used to acquire CSPR). Potential purchasers and holders of CSPR are urged to carefully review this Whitepaper and assess and understand the risk factors relating to the CSPR and the Casper blockchain before acquiring CSPR (when and if CSPR become available).</p></li><li><p>*<!-- -->*<!-- -->Risks associated with (intellectual) property rights: the Recipient understands and accepts that, due to a lack of originality of the software and to the immaterial character of the CSPR, there may be no title of ownership in and to the intellectual property rights relating to CSPR.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with blockchain</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that the smart contract, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Casper blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. The Recipient understands and accepts that there is no warranty that the process for creating the CSPR and/or the Casper blockchain will be uninterrupted or error-free and acknowledges that there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of CSPR. The Recipient understands and accepts that, after launch of the Casper blockchain, the smart contract and/or underlying protocols and/or the Casper blockchain and/or any other software involved may either delay and/or not execute a contribution due to the overall contribution volume, mining attacks and/or similar events.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk of weaknesses in the field of cryptography</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that cryptography is a technology that evolves relatively fast over time. At the same time, methods and tools to decrypt, access and/or manipulate data stored on a distributed ledger or blockchain are highly likely to progress in parallel and in addition, new technological developments such as quantum computers may pose as of now unpredictable risks to the CSPR and the Casper blockchain that could increase the risk of theft or loss of CSPR (if and when CSPR are created and/or issued).</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory risks</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, distributed ledger technology and/or blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the smart contract or the CasperLabs Networks AG project and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the smart contract and/or the CasperLabs Networks AG project, including its termination and the loss of the CSPR, if and when created and/or issued, or entitlements to receive CSPR, for the Recipient.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with abandonment / lack of success</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that the creation of the CSPR and the development of the Casper blockchain as well as the CasperLabs Networks AG project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects) and legal, tax or regulatory considerations. The Recipient therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the CSPR/CasperLabs blockchain project is partially or fully developed and launched, the Recipient will receive any benefits through the CSPR held by it (if and when created and/or issued).</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with a loss of private key</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that CSPR, if and when created and/or issued, will only be accessed by using a wallet technically compatible with CSPR and with a combination of the Recipient’s account information (address) and private key, seed or password. The Recipient understands and accepts that if its private key or password gets lost or stolen, the CSPR associated with the Recipient’s account (address) will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with wallets</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that CasperLabs Networks AG or any of its affiliates, employees, partners or advisors are in no way responsible for the wallet to which any CSPR are transferred. The Recipient understands and agrees that it is solely responsible for the access and security of its wallet, for any security breach of its wallet and/or with any loss of CSPR resulting from its wallet service provider, including any termination of the service by the wallet provider and/or bankruptcy of the wallet provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with theft/hacks</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that the smart contract, the website, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Casper blockchain), during its development and after its launch, may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that could result in an inability to launch the Casper blockchain or the theft or loss of CSPR. Any such event could also result in the loss of financial and other support of the CasperLabs Networks AG project impacting the ability to develop the CasperLabs Networks AG project and Casper blockchain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with mining attacks</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies and tokens, if and when launched, the Casper blockchain is susceptible to attacks relating to validators. Any successful attack presents a risk to the smart contract, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with a lack of consensus</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that the network of validators will be ultimately in control of the genesis block and future blocks and that there is no warranty or assurance that the network of validators will perform their functions and reach proper consensus and allocate the CSPR to the Recipient as proposed by any terms. The Recipient further understands that a majority of the validators could agree at any point to make changes to the software and/or smart contracts and to run the new version of the software and/or smart contracts. Such a scenario could lead to the CSPR losing intrinsic value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with liquidity of CSPR</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that with regard to the CSPR, if and when created and/or issued, no market liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value of CSPR relative to other assets, including fiat currency and/or any other cryptocurrency (including any cryptocurrency used to acquire CSPR) over time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate in full (including to zero) resulting in loss that will be borne exclusively by the Recipient.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risks associated with forking</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that hard and soft forks as well as similar events may, inter alia, lead to the creation of new or competing tokens to the CSPR, adversely affect the functionality, convertibility or transferability or result in a full or partial loss of units or reduction (including reduction to zero) of value of the Recipient’s CSPR (if and when created and/or issued).</p></li></ul></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-tags-row row margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_XVD_ padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/must-read/">Must read</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/legal/">Legal</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/introduction/">Introduction</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/casper-labs/">CasperLabs</a></li><li class="tag_JSN8"><a class="tag_hD8n tagRegular_D6E_" href="/tags/cspr/">CSPR</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/casper-network/docs/tree/main/source/docs/casper/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_dcUD" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_foO9"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2023-02-09T13:44:35.000Z">2/9/2023</time></b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_cNA8 thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#what-is-casper" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What is Casper?</a></li><li><a href="#how-does-casper-work" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">How does Casper work?</a></li><li><a href="#where-can-i-learn-more" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Where can I learn more?</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright"><div class="footer-inner-container">
