# ERC-20 Tutorial

This tutorial introduces you to an implementation of the ERC-20 standard for the Casper blockchain.

The Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC-20) standard is an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem. This standard is well established for building new tokens based on smart contracts. These ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be transferred or recorded.

The ERC-20 standard defines a set of rules that dictate the total supply of tokens, how the tokens are transferred, how transactions are approved, and how token data is accessed. These rules are implemented using the following functions defined by ERC-20, `totalSupply`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `balanceOf`, and `allowance`, which are described in detail within this tutorial.

The code for this tutorial is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/erc20). If you havenâ€™t read [Writing Rust Contracts on Casper](../dapp-dev-guide/writing-contracts/writing-rust-contracts.md), we recommend you start there.
