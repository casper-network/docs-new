# Recommended Hardware Specifications

## System Requirements {#system-requirements}

MainNet and TestNet

-   4 Cores
-   32 GB Ram
-   1 TB SSD or network SSD backed disk
-   Linux machine running Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 (preferred) with a Rust build environment.

SDD is required because HDD cannot perform random writes at the performance needed to keep in sync with the full speed of the network.

For non-archival nodes, disc usage will drop once data recovery is implemented. It is safe to slowly increase disc space as needed if monitored and on a server capable of this.
