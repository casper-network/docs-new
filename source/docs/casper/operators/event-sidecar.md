# The Casper Event Sidecar

The Casper Event Sidecar is an application running alongside the node process, allowing subscribers to monitor the event stream without querying the node. The application usually runs on the same machine as the node process, but it can be configured to run remotely if necessary. The load on the node process is thus drastically reduced. Users needing access to the JSON-RPC will still need to query the node directly.

An alternate name for this application is the SSE Sidecar because it uses the node's Event Stream API returning Server-Sent Events (SSEs) in JSON format. Visit GitHub for detailed information on the following:

## Configuring the Sidecar {#configuring-the-sidecar}

If the service was installed on a Casper node, this file holds a default configuration: `/etc/casper-event-sidecar/config.toml`. Operators will need to update this file according to their needs. GitHub has further details regarding each configuration option.
