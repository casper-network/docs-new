# Operators

Operators who wish to run node infrastructure on a Casper network, either as a standalone private network, or as part of the public network should explore this section.

Prior knowledge of Unix-based operating systems and proficiency with systemd and bash scripting are recommended. If you are unfamiliar with systemd, the [Arch Linux page on systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd) is a good introduction.
