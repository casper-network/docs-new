# Operators

Operators who wish to run node infrastructure on a Casper network, either as a standalone private network, or as part of the public network should explore this section.

Prior knowledge of Unix-based operating systems and proficiency with systemd and bash scripting are recommended. If you are unfamiliar with systemd, the [Arch Linux page on systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd) is a good introduction.

## Requirements

1. Operators should know the [Hardware requirements](./setup/hardware.md) before running a node.

2. Also, the [Network requirements](./setup/install-node.md/#network-requirements) specify how to open ports and modify the network firewall to which the node is connected. This step is necessary to allow incoming connections, enabling communication among nodes.

## Content Overview

Review the [node's configuration](./setup/basic-node-configuration.md) first. 

Then, you can follow the node [installation instructions](./setup/install-node.md).

To research a specific node feature, set up a private network, or become a validator, review the [Table of Contents](./table-of-contents.md) for Operators.
