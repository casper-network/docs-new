# Operators

Operators who wish to run node infrastructure on a Casper network, either as a standalone private network, or as part of the public network should explore this section.

Prior knowledge of Unix-based operating systems and proficiency with systemd and bash scripting are recommended. If you are unfamiliar with systemd, the [Arch Linux page on systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd) is a good introduction.

# Requirements
1. Operators should be aware of the [Hardware requirements](./setup/hardware.md) before considering to run a node.

2. Also, make sure you are aware of the [Network requirements](./setup/install-node.md/#network-requirements) as you will have to open ports / modify the firewall of the network the node is connected to. This is necessary to allow incoming connections, enabling communication between nodes.

# Content overview
If you are familiar with the Casper node and want to quickly setup a new instance, you may skip to the [Installation instructions](./setup/install-node.md). Otherwise, it's recommended to review the [Configuration instructions](./setup/basic-node-configuration.md) first.

To research a specific feature of the node, setup a private network, or become a validator, review the [Table of Contents](./table-of-contents.md) for Operators.
