# Smart Contracts

## Smart Contracts in General

A smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required in a digital agreement. Once completed, the transactions are trackable and irreversible. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

## Casper Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts in Casper are implemented in the Rust programming language, and compiled to [WASM](../concepts/glossary/W.md#webassembly) which is then installed and executed on-chain. You can find a guide to writing a simple smart contract [here](../developers/writing-onchain-code/simple-contract.md). Smart Contracts are installed to the chain as part of a [Deploy](../concepts/glossary/D.md#deploy).
