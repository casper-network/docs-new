# Smart Contracts

## Smart Contracts in General

A smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required in a digital agreement. Once completed, the transactions are trackable and irreversible. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

## Casper Smart Contracts

Casper smart contracts can be implemented in any programming language that compiles to [Wasm](../concepts/glossary/W.md#webassembly), which can be installed and executed on-chain using [Deploys](../concepts/glossary/D.md#deploy). Most documentation examples and the Casper system contracts are written in Rust. You can find a guide to writing a simple, smart contract in Rust [here](../developers/writing-onchain-code/simple-contract.md).
