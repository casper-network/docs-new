# Casper Concepts

Working with the Casper blockchain requires an understanding of a number of core concepts. Some of these concepts are more generally applicable to blockchain technology, and others are Casper-specific. If you are new to Casper, we recommend that you first familiarize yourself with these concepts in order to prevent confusion at a further stage of your educative process.
