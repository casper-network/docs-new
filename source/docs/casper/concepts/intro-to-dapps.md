# Introduction to dApps (Distributed Applications)

## Definition of a dApp

DApp stands for **Decentralized Application**. Specifically, it refers to an app built on a blockchain network which combines smart contracts and a user interface.
To be considered a dApp, an app should fulfill the following requirements:

- Decentralized: DApps are run by multiple nodes around the globe. No party can take control of them, including governments and the developers.
- Deterministic: Changes in the environment do not affect the execution of a dApp.
- Turing complete: DApps can perform any action given the required resources.
- Isolated: DApps are executed in an isolated situation. If a DApp has a bug, it won't affect the normal functioning of the blockchain network.

A dApp is not a client-server application, where the application can do some work offline. Nor is it a web application that can operate in a disconnected mode, where there is a central server which acts as a repository of information and business logic. A dApp’s concept and construction depend on a distributed architecture where a network of nodes processes the installation and invocation of smart contracts, rather than through a central server.

## Benefits of a dApp

1. Durability/uptime characteristics

Due to the fact that each operation on a dApp is processed by one or many identical nodes in a network, failure of a single node has no effect on the overall operation of the network. DApps can maintain 24/7, uninterrupted uptime without investment in massive data centers or secure facilities. A dApp cannot be attacked by Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.
2. User privacy

You do not need to provide real-world identification, such as a Google or Facebook account, to interact with a blockchain network.
3. Resistance to outside control. No single entity can block another from accessing the blockchain, reading data, deploying or interacting with DApps, or submitting transactions to the chain.
4. Trust in the state of the blockchain

Data stored on the blockchain is immutable and decentralized, rather than relying on a centralized authority. Users may not change the transaction record or any other data present on the blockchain.


## Downsides to dApps

1. Maintenance: Compared to traditional applications, once a DApp is published, it is more difficult to maintain as the data is stored on the Blockchain which is immutable. If bugs are found, developers can’t fix them as easily as with a traditional client-server architecture.
2. Network Efficiency

DApp networks and platforms need to reach consensus before mutating the state of the chain. This means that processing millions of transactions per second, such as in a low-latency trading or betting applications, is not possible. Dapps are not the correct architecture for applications that require high network performance.

## Some popular use cases

1. DeFi
[De-Fi (Decentralized Finance)](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) refers to a movement towards financial systems without the need for centralized authorities, like banks or governments, to act as intermediaries and verify transactions. This is enabled by the "trustless" model provided under a blockchain system, where the validity of a transaction is ensured by the very nature of the platform. This represents a challenge to traditional systems of digital finance, with additional possibilities and concerns.
2. Gaming apps and NFTs
  [Game-Fi](https://gamefi.org/) is a gaming model based on blockchain technology. Through GameFi, users of a gaming app can earn cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens [(NFT)](/concepts/glossary/N/#non-fungible-token). These items can then be traded in the market, allowing players to securely earn money while gaming.
