# Introduction to DApps (Distributed Applications)

### Definition of a DApp
    DApps (Decentralized applications) are applications built and executing on a decentralized Blockchain network.
    They usually combine smart contracts and a front-end user interface.

    - Characteristics of DApps:
        - Decentralized: DApps are run by thousands of nodes around the globe. No party can take control of it, including governments and the developers.
        - Deterministic: The execution of DApps is not affected by any changes in the environment.
        - Turing complete: DApps can perform any action given the required resources.
        - Isolated: DApps are executed in an isolated situation. If a DApp has a bug, it won't affect the normal functioning of the Blockchain network.
