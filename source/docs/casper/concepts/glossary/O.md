## Operator {#operator}

Anyone running a node is an operator.

An operator that has staked a bid but does not currently have a validator slot is a \*staked operator\*.

An operator whose bid has won a validator slot in the auction for a specific era is a [validator](/concepts/glossary/V.md#validator) in that era.

It is common for a _staked operator_ to win an auction slot for many eras in a row and thus be a validator for a range of eras.
