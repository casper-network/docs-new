# Introduction

The following topics describe how to use the Casper command-line client to transfer tokens between accounts on a Casper Network. Depending on the type of accounts, you can choose a direct transfer or a multiple signature (multi-sig) deploy transfer.  

**Transferring Tokens using Direct Transfer**

You can use the direct method to transfer tokens when you have an account with a single primary key and it is capable of signing a transaction. To use a direct transfer, see [Transferring Tokens using Direct Transfer](transfer-workflow.md)

**Transferring Tokens using Multi-sig Deploy**

When the account used to initiate the transfer has multiple associated keys that need to sign the deploy, you can use a multi-sig deploy transfer. To use a multi-sig deploy transfer, see [Transferring Tokens using Multi-sig Account](deploy-transfer.md)

**Verifying a Transfer using the Command-line Client**

Once you have transferred the tokens, you might want to verify that the transfer was successful. To verify the status of the transfer, see [Verifying a Transfer](verify-transfer.md)
