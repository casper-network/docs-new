# Casper Network

<details>
 <summary><b><h3>What is Casper?</h3></b></summary>

Casper is an open-source Proof-of-Stake blockchain network built off the CBC ([Correct-by-Construction](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper)) Casper specification originally established by early Ethereum developers. The Casper network is optimized for enterprise and developer adoption by focusing on unique features like upgradeable contracts, predictable network fees, privacy flexibility, on-chain governance, and developer-friendly languages. Casper solves the scalability trilemma by allowing development teams to build with confidence that the network will optimize for security, decentralization, and high throughput.

 <summary><b><h3>When is Casper's mainnet launch?</h3></b></summary>

Casper's mainnet launch will occur in Q1 2021.

 <summary><b><h3>How does Casper solve the trilemma of security, decentralization, and scalability? </h3></b></summary>

As a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network, Casper relies on a set of validators to uphold the network. PoS validators do not require the same hardware setup as Proof-of-Work networks, allowing validators to be more geographically decentralized and eliminating the centralizing pressures of economies of scale. PoS also enables scalability mechanisms like sharding, a forthcoming feature to allow the network to process multiple transactions simultaneously, improving overall throughput.

  <summary><b><h3>What is unique about Casper's blockchain architecture?</h3></b></summary>

The Highway Protocol is the specific implementation of PoS that supports the Casper network. Highway has two primary benefits over classic Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanisms. First, Highway enables the network to reach higher thresholds of finality. Second, it achieves flexibility in a way not possible in typical BFT models.

  <summary><b><h3>Why is Casper a good fit for enterprises and developers? </h3></b></summary>

Casper is optimized for enterprise and developers through three main features: upgradeable contracts, developer-friendly languages, and forthcoming predictable network fees.

-   **Upgradeable Contracts**. Casper enables on-chain smart contracts to be directly upgraded, removing the need for complex and migration processes and making it easier to patch smart contract vulnerabilities.
-   **Developer-Friendly Languages**. Casper supports developers building with WebAssembly. The network's development ecosystem is designed to be familiar to existing Web2 developers instead of being written in a proprietary language like Solidity. This provides an easier path for developers and businesses to start building with Casper immediately.
-   **Predictable Network Fees (In Development)**. Casper intends to incentivize active and diverse network behavior by establishing consistent, predictable, and transparent gas costs - eliminating volatility and improving both developer and user experience.

  <summary><b><h3>What's an example of the Casper network in use?</h3></b></summary>

IPwe is a global patent registry currently building on the Casper network. CasperLabs and IPwe have partnered to build a chain of custody (CoC) solution for public patent records. The "CoC Solution" will use the Casper public blockchain to store, secure, and trace patent data. [Learn more](https://blog.casperlabs.io/intellectual-property-and-patent-assets-on-casper/).

# CasperLabs

<details>
  <summary><b><h3>What's the difference between CasperLabs and Casper?</h3></b></summary>

CasperLabs is the development team that is currently building the Casper network. CasperLabs has been developing Casper during its testnet phase and is currently planning for mainnet launch in Q1 2021. As a public, open-source network, Casper can be developed on and by anyone in addition to the CasperLabs team.

<details>
  <summary><b><h3>What's the CasperLabs team's background?</h3></b></summary>

The engineering, executive, business, and marketing teams of CasperLabs are diverse groups of thinkers and builders with decades of experience in internet-scale computing systems across academia, business, and engineering. [Meet the CasperLabs team](https://casperlabs.io/company/meet-our-team/).

<details>
  <summary><b><h3>What is CasperLabs' fundraising history?</h3></b></summary>

In September 2019, CasperLabs raised a \$14.5 million Series A round led by Terren Piezer with participation from Consensus Capital, Axiom Holdings Group, and Digital Strategies, MW Partners, and more.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b><h3>Who has partnered with CasperLabs to build on the Casper network?</h3></b></summary>

CasperLabs has established a diverse ecosystem of participants who will be building, staking, and validating on Casper from day one, spanning blockchain, enterprise technology, and financial services. Among others, CasperLabs has established relationships with BitGo, Huobi, Ledger Leap, Chainlink, Metis, and Cardinal Cryptography. Companies including IPwe and Broadleaf are already using the Casper Network to unlock new value by tokenizing existing assets.

# CSPR Token

<details>
  <summary><b><h3>What is CSPR, and its role in the Casper network?</h3></b></summary>

CSPR is the native token to the Casper network. As a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, Casper relies on CSPR to reward the validators that participate in the PoS consensus mechanism to secure and uphold the network. Casper users also rely on CSPR to pay network fees for on-chain actions. For example, each token transfer costs 0.0001 CSPR (10000 motes) and the amount transferred needs to be 2.5 CSPR or more.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b><h3>Where can I find information about CSPR, the supply, the allocation, and the sale? </h3></b></summary>

The Casper Association has launched its CSPR token sale. Head to [casper.network](https://casper.network/) to learn more.
