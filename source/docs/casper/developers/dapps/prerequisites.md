# Prerequisites

Before trying your hand at dApp development on the Casper Network, there are a few things you should do first:

1. Be sure you understand the language(s) you are developing in

   Before beginning with one or more of the SDKs, ensure that you are familiar with the underlying language itself. There are many guides and tutorials available online to help you.

2. Familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of the Casper Network

   The Casper Network is a Proof-of-Stake smart contract blockchain written in Rust. Its architecture, from how it validates transactions to how it reaches consensus, should be well understood before developing dApps that interact with it. Read up on the Casper Network's design principles at [docs.casperlabs.io/design](https://docs.casperlabs.io/design).

3. Read the documentation of your chosen SDK

   Many of the Casper Network's SDKs have documentation available to help you get a full grasp of the functions and methods within it. In all cases, documentation is written in the source files and rendered using a markup language. Check the repository of your preferred SDKs for links to documentation.

When developing a public dApp for the Casper Network, it is important to keep security in mind and write your smart contract(s) and interface(s) with caution and care, especially if your dApp interacts with tokens of value.
