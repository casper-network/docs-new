# Casper Cep-78 NFT standard
Learn to install and manage instantiations of the [Cep-78 NFT standard](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep-78-enhanced-nft/) with different configurations.

## Metadata
The structure of an NFTs metadata is defined by a json schema. Cep-78 supports both standardized and custom json schemes. Standardized schemes are easier to integrate, whilst custom schemes can be individualized to suit a projects needs best.

Example metadata in Cep-78 form:

```json
{
  "name": "Example NFT",
  "token_uri": "https://SOME_BACKEND/id",
  "checksum":
  "0x00..."
}
```
In this example the webserver at _token_uri_ should return json data containing all relevant information regarding the NFT, such as a url to the image/jpg file, name and description.

Alternatively, one could define a custom metadata schema to, for example, store binary data instead of a weblink as the NFT's metadata.

Example custom metadata schema:

```json
{
   "properties":{
      "nft_name":{
         "name":"some_name",
         "description":"some_description",
         "required":true
      },
      "nft_binary_data":{
         "name":"some_binary_data",
         "description":"some_description",
         "required":true
      },
   }
}
```

## Install an instantiation of the Cep-78 contract
An instantiation of the Cep-78 contract is essentially an NFT collection that hold different methods like _Mint_, _Burn_ and _Transfer_,
as well as references to metadata on the storage system of the Blockchain.

### Requirements
1. Dependencies
- libssl-dev
- curl
- cmake
- pkg-config
```bash
$ sudo apt install libssl-dev curl cmake pkg-config
```

2. Setup
```
1. install Rust and default to nightly toolchain
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
$ rustup default nightly
2. install casper-client command line tool
$ cargo install casper-client
```

### Compile the Cep-78 contract
```bash
$ make prepare
$ make build-contract

the compiled contract.wasm will be in ./contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release
```

### Deploy the Cep-78 contract
```bash
$ casper-client put-deploy --node-address <NODE_ADDRESS> --chain-name casper-test --secret-key <PATH_TO_SECRET_KEY> --payment-amount <GAS_FEE_IN_MOTE> --session-path <PATH_TO_contract.wasm> --session-arg <see below>
```
-> returns a _deploy hash_. Once the deploy was successfully processed, the instance of Cep-78 should be installed on the Blockchain.

### Session Arguments (skip if familiar)
List of **mandatory session arguments**:

- _collection_name_: The name of the NFT collection, passed in as a String. This parameter is required and cannot be changed post installation.
- _collection_symbol_: The symbol representing a given NFT collection, passed in as a String. This parameter is required and cannot be changed post installation.
- _total_token_supply_: The total number of NFTs that a specific instance of a contract will mint passed in as a U64 value. This parameter is required and cannot be changed post installation.
- _ownership_mode_: The OwnershipMode modality that dictates the ownership behavior of the NFT contract. This argument is passed in as a u8 value and is required at the time of installation.
- _nft_kind_: The NFTKind modality that specifies the off-chain items represented by the on-chain NFT data. This argument is passed in as a u8 value and is required at the time of installation.
- _json_schema_: The JSON schema for the NFT tokens that will be minted by the NFT contract passed in as a String. This parameter is required if the metadata kind is set to CustomValidated(4) and cannot be changed post installation.
- _nft_metadata_kind_: The metadata schema for the NFTs to be minted by the NFT contract. This argument is passed in as a u8 value and is required at the time of installation.
- _identifier_mode_: The NFTIdentifierMode modality dictates the primary identifier for NFTs minted by the contract. This argument is passed in as a u8 value and is required at the time of installation.
- _metadata_mutability_: The MetadataMutability modality dictates whether the metadata of minted NFTs can be updated. This argument is passed in as a u8 value and is required at the time of installation.

## Mint an NFT
Mint an NFT by calling the previously installed instance of the Cep-78 NFT standard.

### Query your account
```bash
$ casper-client get-state-root-hash <node-address>
-> outputs "state-root-hash"
$ casper-client get-account-state --node-address<NODE_ADDRESS> --state-root-hash <STATE_ROOT_HASH> --key <account-hash-YOUR_ACCOUNT_HASH>
-> find "contract_hash" of deploy named "nft_contract" in output and copy it.
```
get-account-state returns a list of associated keys. One of these associated keys should be the _contract hash_ of the Cep-78 instance.

### Call the _Mint_ entry point to produce an NFT with some _metadata_
```bash
  [Example]

  $ casper-client put-deploy \
  --node-address http://136.243.187.84:7777 \
  --chain-name casper-test \
  --secret-key ./private.pem \
  --payment-amount 1000000000 \
  --session-hash hash-b4b78992e0324be09f174637c3dda2d29cc5c21c44430b72a0943d3ba6d2c827 \
  --session-entry-point mint \
  --session-arg "token_owner:key='account-hash-5a54f173e71d3c219940dcb9dfec222b024cd81aa7e0672de59ba5fab296448b'" \
  --session-arg "token_meta_data:string='{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"token_uri\":\"https://www.barfoo.cong\",\"checksum\":\"940bffb3f2bba35f84313aa26da09ece3ad47045c6a1292c2bbd2df4ab1a55fc\"}'"
  -> outputs a deploy hash.
```
Once this deploy was successful, our Cep-78 standard NFT should live on the blockchain.

**Note that in this example we use an instance of Cep-78 with the _cep-78 standard metadata schema_. Review the _Modalities_ in the [readme](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep-78-enhanced-nft/) if this is unclear at this point of the tutorial.**

## Query NFTs
Retrieve information about NFTs and owners.

### Query owned NFTs by account
In order to access the Metadata of an NFT, it is necessary to know which NFTs are owned by a given account. The Cep-78 contractâ€™s named_keys store contain a dictionary named _owned_tokens_.

Find the Ids or Hashs of NFTs owned by your account. Whether your NFT is identified by a hash identifier or numerical Id depends on the modality _NFTIdentifierModethat_ defaults to _Ordinal_ (numerical instead of hash):

```bash
  [Example]

  $ casper-client get-dictionary-item \
  -n http://136.243.187.84:7777 \
  -s 256d0445121f1144a09394c739c9baf82b5624b66dced181a0c1c8b8e936652b \
  --account-hash hash-b4b78992e0324be09f174637c3dda2d29cc5c21c44430b72a0943d3ba6d2c827 \
  --dictionary-name owned_tokens \
  --dictionary-item-key 5a54f173e71d3c219940dcb9dfec222b024cd81aa7e0672de59ba5fab296448b
```
where --dictionary-item-key is set to my account-hash and -s is a new state-root-hash.
```json
A copy of the output:
{
  "id": 6249115604543280689,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "api_version": "1.4.6",
    "dictionary_key": "dictionary-6bded5cf061dd95463e0064996f24cb88d19a6a7b24962a1347a5392356a35a0",
    "merkle_proof": "[38054 hex chars]",
    "stored_value": {
      "CLValue": {
        "bytes": "[280 hex chars]",
        "cl_type": {
          "List": "String"
        },
        "parsed": [
          "8bc73bf6cfdb48d0e88f16e0c02d5adff6c60a61a4b6bd65349d75fcb7b500d8",
          "0e557acd2b5a43a91c23c2f0e01687cc8a5342e105be22777b7bf97daf757c4f"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The _parsed_ value is a list of _hash identifiers_ representing all NFTs owned by the account:
```json
  "8bc73bf6cfdb48d0e88f16e0c02d5adff6c60a61a4b6bd65349d75fcb7b500d8",
  "0e557acd2b5a43a91c23c2f0e01687cc8a5342e105be22777b7bf97daf757c4f"
```

### Query NFT metadata from the Blockchain
The metadata that is passed as an argument when minting an NFT using Cep-78 is saved in a dictionary on the blockchain, where the key is the hash or numeric identifier, depending on the _identifier_mode_ modality. The name of the dictionary depends on the _metadata_kind_ modality.

The NFT metadata can be found in the related dictionary:

```bash
1. "metadata_custom_validated"
2. "metadata_cep78"
3. "metadata_nft721"
4. "metadata_raw"
```

```javascript
  const client = await new CasperClient(node_addr);
  var cep78_contract = new Contracts.Contract(client);
  cep78_contract.setContractHash(cep78_contract_hash);
  const nft_hashes = [YOUR_NFT_HASH_IDs];
  let meta = [];
  for (item in nft_hashes) {
    console.log("Item is: ", nft_hashes[item].toString());
    await cep78_contract.queryContractDictionary(
      "metadata_custom_validated",
      nft_hashes[item]
    ).then(response => {
      meta.push(response.data);
    }).catch(error => {
      console.log(error);
    })
  }
```
This examples shows how the javascript SDK can be used to query metadata for a list of _nft hashes_. The _metadata_custom_validated_ indicates, that the instance of Cep-78 in use was configured to support a custom metadata schema, not the Cep-78 or NFT-721 standard. Always make sure to query the correct dictionary for your configuration.
