# Prerequisites

To develop a smart Contract on Casper Blockchain you will be primarily using Rust. Follow the [instructions](../../../developers/prerequisites.md) to check/install the software necessary for development.

Using Node.js is not possible for writing contracts on Casper as we do not offer the SDKs for writing contracts in javascript. There are SDKs in javascript available for connecting from the frontend to the Casper Blockchain.
