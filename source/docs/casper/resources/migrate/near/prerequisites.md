# Prerequisites

To develop a smart Contract on Casper Blockchain you will be primarily using Rust. Follow the [instructions](../../../developers/prerequisites.md) to check/install the software necessary for development.

Note: for NEAR developers familiar with development in JavaScript, and looking to develop in JavaScript for Casper; we do not support developing Smart Contracts in Javascript for the Casper platform. We do, however, support dApp development in JavaScript, and provide an SDK to support such activity. You can find this in the Developers section under [SDK](/developers/dapps/sdk).
