# Upgrading Contracts

Our smart contract packaging tools enable you to:

-   Upgrade your contracts and specify how the state of the contract is managed
-   Specify whether a contract is upgradable or immutable
-   Version your contracts and deprecate old versions
-   Set permissions around who can perform contract upgrades

To learn more about how to upgrade your smart contracts, see the [Smart Contract Upgrade Tutorial](../tutorials/upgrade-tutorial).
