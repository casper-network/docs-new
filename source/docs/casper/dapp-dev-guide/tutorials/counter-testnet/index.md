# A Counter on the Testnet

This tutorial installs a simple counter contract on the Casper Testnet. The contract is straightforward and simply maintains a counter variable. If you want to learn to send deploys to a local Casper Network, you can follow a [similar tutorial](/dapp-dev-guide/tutorials/counter/index.md) and work with NCTL. Once you are familiar with this process, the next step will be to write more practical smart contracts.

Before we go through the tutorial, we will give a high-level overview of this tutorial's walkthrough and briefly summarize the relevant commands (and respective arguments).
