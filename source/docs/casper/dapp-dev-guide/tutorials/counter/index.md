# A Counter on an NCTL Network

This tutorial installs a simple counter contract on a local Casper Network with NCTL. The contract is straightforward and simply maintains a counter variable. If you want to learn to send deploys to the Testnet, you can follow a [similar tutorial](/dapp-dev-guide/tutorials/counter-testnet/index.md). Once you are familiar with this process, the next step will be to write more practical smart contracts.

Before we go through the tutorial, we will give a high-level overview of this tutorial's walkthrough and briefly summarize the relevant commands (and respective arguments).
