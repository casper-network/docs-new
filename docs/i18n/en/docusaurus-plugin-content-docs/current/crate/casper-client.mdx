Build Status Crates.io Documentation License

A command line tool for creating a Wasm smart contract and tests for use on the Casper network.

## License

## Installation

cargo casper is a Cargo subcommand which can be installed via cargo install:

```
cargo install cargo-casper
```

To install from the latest dev branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node
cd casper-node/execution_engine_testing/cargo_casper
cargo install cargo-casper --path=.
```

## Usage

To create a folder "my_project" containing an example contract and a separate test crate for the contract:

cargo casper my_project This creates the following files:

```
my_project/
├── contract
│   ├── .cargo
│   │   └── config
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── rust-toolchain
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
├── tests
│   ├── build.rs
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── rust-toolchain
│   ├── src
│   │   └── integration_tests.rs
└── .travis.yml
```

### Building the contract

To build the contract, the correct version of Rust must be installed along with the Wasm target:

```
cd my_project/contract
rustup install $(cat rust-toolchain)
rustup target add --toolchain=$(cat rust-toolchain) wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The contract can now be built using:

```
cargo build --release
```

and will be built to my_project/contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm.

### Testing the contract

Running the test will automatically build the contract in release mode, copy it to the "tests/wasm" folder, then build and run the test:

```
cd my_project/tests
cargo test
```
