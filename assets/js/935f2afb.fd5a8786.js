You can change an unlocked contract package by adding a new contract and updating the default contract version that the contract package should use. You will need to know the contract package hash and use the addcontractversion API. You can also create a locked contract package that cannot be versioned and is therefore not upgradable.","sidebar":"resources"},"resources/tutorials/beginner/use-javascript-sdk":{"id":"resources/tutorials/beginner/use-javascript-sdk","title":"Using the JavaScript SDK","description":"This tutorial shows you how to use the JavaScript SDK by connecting the Casper Signer to a website, get the balance of an account\'s main purse and send a Deploy."},"resources/tutorials/index":{"id":"resources/tutorials/index","title":"Overview","description":"-   Beginner Tutorials","sidebar":"resources"},"users/block-explorer":{"id":"users/block-explorer","title":"Block Explorers on Casper Network","description":"The Casper blockchain is available as the Mainnet and Testnet.
